HEL Service Map Bright is a map theme based on [OSM Bright][].

### Mapbox style

For vector tile rendering of [OpenMapTiles][] imported OSM data, a [Mapbox Style][] re-enactment of the
original design is now included as `templates/hel-osm-bright.json`. The generated style can be opened
and edited with [Maputnik][].

[OpenMapTiles]: https://github.com/openmaptiles/openmaptiles
[MapBox Style]: https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/
[Maputnik]: https://maputnik.github.io/
[Tileserver GL]: https://github.com/klokantech/tileserver-gl
[MapBox GL JS]: https://openmaptiles.org/docs/website/mapbox-gl-js/

To use the style on a server, just follow [OpenMapTiles][] and [Tileserver GL][] instructions. To use the
style on a web client, you may use [MapBox GL JS][] or any other JS library that supports Mapbox styles.
